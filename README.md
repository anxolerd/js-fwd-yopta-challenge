# JS FWD YoptaChallenge

This is an implementation of determinant calculation using the Laplace expansion method.
It was implemented as a submission to a challenge by [@itkpi](https://github.com/itkpi) which is described [in this post](https://vk.com/itkpi?w=wall-42456628_23536).

There are two implementations -- pure js and yoptascript.
